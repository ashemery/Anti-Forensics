-- DOCX: extract and hide other content within the structure, all you need to do is change them to .xml
-- RAR, 7zip: modify their structures to hold/hide other data
-- etc
- Data Hiding
- Steganography

## Great ideas
- "" The key thing to understand is this:
1. You don't *have* to do anti-forensics in most cases; it's likely not necessary.
2. Don't delete artifacts when you can configure the system so that they're never written.""
